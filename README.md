# siamese-neural-networks
An implementation of siamese neural networks in PyTorch based on the original paper [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf).

My final accuracy in the "evaluation" set (different alphabets from the "background" set, this terminology is defined by the authors of the Omniglot dataset) is 92.62, which is almost the same accuracy reported in the paper, which is 92.0.
